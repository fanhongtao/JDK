                      JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
                                  v 1.2.2

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading this release of the JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard
Edition. The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for building
applications, applets, and components that can be deployed on the Java
platform. A Japanese version of this README is on the Java Software
website at: http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/ja/README.html

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and testing
programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java
platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command line. Except 
for appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user interface. 

The Win32 version of the Java 2 SDK includes the Java Plug-in. You can use
the Java Plug-in to enable the Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator
browsers to run applets based on the Java 2 platform. 

The Linux version of the Java 2 SDK v 1.2.2 does not include Java Plug-in.
Future plans call for a Linux port of Java Plug-in and inclusion of it as
part of the Linux JRE. 

For more information about the Java Plug-in, including how to obtain a
Solaris version, see the section Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java
Plug-in below. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java 2 SDK offers significant improvements in functionality, performance, 
security and global support over previous versions of the Java platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java 2 SDK Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java 2 SDK Documentation contains API specifications, developer guides, 
tool reference pages, demos, and links to related information. This 
documentation is also available in a download bundle which you can install
locally with your Java 2 SDK software. See the Java 2 SDK download page
at http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Java 2 SDK software is available on four platforms: 

     * Win32 Version for Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 on
       Intel hardware. A 486/DX or faster processor. 32 megabytes RAM
       minimum, 48 megabytes RAM recommended. 

     * Solaris/SPARC Version. Only Solaris versions 2.5.1, 2.6 and 7 (also
       known as 2.7) are supported. 32 megabytes RAM minimum, 48 megabytes
       RAM recommended. 

     * Solaris/Intel Version. Only Solaris versions 2.5.1, 2.6 and 7 (also
       known as 2.7) are supported. A 486/DX or faster processor. 32
       megabytes RAM minimum, 48 megabytes RAM recommended. 

     * Linux/Intel Version This version of the Java 2 SDK is supported on
       Intel Pentium platform running the Linux kernel v 2.2.5 and glibc 
       v 2.1, 32 megabytes RAM minimum. Recommended 48 megabytes of RAM,
       16-bit color mode, KDE and KWM window managers. 

On all systems you should have 65 megabytes of free disk space before
attempting to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install the
separate documentation download bundle, you need an additional 90
megabytes of free disk space. 

Solaris users will want to check the list of recommended and required patches 
on the Java Software web site:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/install-solaris-patches.html 

It is strongly recommended that Solaris 2.6 users load the SUNWi1of package 
for optional Latin-1 fonts. This package is in the "Entire Distribution"
Cluster, available on the Solaris software installation CD-ROM. SUNWi1of
contains English Monotype TrueType fonts specified in the font properties
files. Without this package, fonts will default to the LucidaSans font for
off-screen text and to Type1 font for text in components. 

Note for Linux users:

     Linux users should check their version of glibc using the following
     command: 

            ls /lib/libc-*

            The output of this command should show libc-2.1.so or higher. 

            We do not support or recommend running the Java 2 SDK on SMP
            kernels. Also the only thread model supported is green threads. 

The Java 2 SDK is localized for Japanese. For more information, see Japanese 
localization notes on the Java Software web site:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/japan-notes.html 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the Release Notes on the Java Software web site for a summary of changes 
to the Java 2 SDK since the previous version and other information pertaining 
to this release. The online release notes will be updated as needed, so you 
should check it occasionally for the latest information. 

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/changes.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See Compatibility with Previous Releases on the Java Software web site for
the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to
support programs written for the 1.0 or 1.1 platform. Although some
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to current 
version with no reprogramming. Any failure to do so is considered a bug,
except for a small number of cases where compatibility was deliberately
broken, as described on our compatibility page. Some compatibility-breaking 
changes were required to close potential security holes or to fix
implementation or design bugs. 

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/compatibility.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demos
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A demo directory is included in the software bundle with a variety of
applets and Swing applications for you to try out. The demos come with
complete source code.

Java programming language source files for all classes that make up the
Java 2 core API (that is, sources files for the java.*, javax.* and
org.omg.* packages, but not for com.sun.* packages). This source code is
provided for informational purposes only, to help developers learn and use
the Java programming language. These files do not include platform-specific 
implementation code and cannot be used to rebuild the class libraries. To
extract these file, use this command: 

                jar xvf src.jar

Do not modify core API source files. To extend the behavior of the core API, 
write subclasses of the core API classes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java Plug-in
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The download bundle for the Win32 version of the Java 2 SDK includes a
redistributable copy of the Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java Plug-in,
which you may optionally choose to install. 

The Java 2 Runtime Environment allows you to run applications written in the 
Java programming language. It consists of the Java virtual machine, classes 
comprising the Java API, and supporting files, but contains no development
tools such as compilers and debuggers. You may freely redistribute the
Java 2 Runtime Environment with your application, according to the terms
of the Runtime Environment's license. Once you've developed your application 
using the Java 2 SDK, you can ship it with the Runtime Environment so your
end-users will have a Java platform on which to run your software. 

Note that the Java 2 SDK has an internal implementation of a Java
runtime environment for its own use. This internal runtime environment is
contained in the SDK software's jre directory. Don't confuse the SDK's
internal runtime environment with the Java 2 Runtime Environment, which is 
a separately installable product. 

The Java 2 Runtime Environment requires additional software -- the Java
Plug-in -- to enable it to run applets in a browser. 

The Java Plug-in software allows Java applets and JavaBeans components to
run in a browser using Sun's Java 2 Runtime Environment instead of the  
browser's default Java environment. The Java Plug-in works with Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. For general information on the
Java Plug-in, see the Java Plug-in Overview:
     
     http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.2/overview.html

For documentation and an FAQ on the Java Plug-in, see Java Plug-in:

     http://java.sun.com/products/plugin 

After you've installed the plug-in, you will see that the "Java
Plug-in control panel" has been added to your Windows "Start" menu under 
"Programs". The plug-in will automatically load the Java runtime
environment when the browser loads an HTML page with a special <OBJECT>
HTML tag. The browser can then load applets from this page to make full
use of 1.2 features, such as JFC (including Swing) and IDL. For details on
how to configure your HTML pages to invoke the Java 2 runtime environment,
see "Documentation" at Sun's Java Plug-in website:

     http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/

Solaris versions of the Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java Plug-in are also 
available. Unlike the Win32 versions of these products, they are
not included as optional parts of the Solaris Java 2 SDK installation. You
can, however, download Solaris versions of the Java 2 Runtime Environment
and Java Plug-in from the Java Software website. 

Download the Solaris version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment from the
Java 2 Runtime Environment download page:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre

To obtain the Solaris version of the Java Plug-in, see Sun's Java Plug-in
website:

     http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/

You may redistribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment and Java Plug-in with your
application, applet or JavaBean components, subject to the terms and conditions
of its software license (found in the /Plug-in README and LICENSE files). 

As mentioned earlier in this document, the Linux version of the Java 2 SDK
v 1.2.2 does not include Java Plug-in. Future plans call for a Linux port
of Java Plug-in and inclusion of it as part of the Linux JRE.
