in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
original work of authorship.  For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
on behalf of the copyright owner.  For the purposes of this definition,
"submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and

   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
   Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
   section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
   and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
   patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
   by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.  If You institute
   patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
   in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
   the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
   terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.  You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
   Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places:  within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
    of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by
    the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear.  The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
    and do not modify the License.  You may add Your own attribution notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
    notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.  Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
   Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
   additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
   shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
   have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  You are solely responsible for determining
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
   associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.  In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
   tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.  While redistributing the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License.  However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
   to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
   accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple Place, Suite
		      330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to
		      copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
		      document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps:  (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also
meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception:  if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent

protections inherent in the Original Code, SGI hereby grants Recipient a 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to do the following:  
(i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI, to reproduce, distribute, create 
derivative works from, and, to the extent applicable, display and perform 
the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI alone and/or as 
part of a Larger Work; and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to make, have

combinations that include the Modification.  No patent license is provided 
under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by Modifications not

 below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and all 
redistributions of Covered Code.  For distributions of the Covered Code in 
source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can include a 
text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this 
License must appear in related documentation or collateral where the 
Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.  Any Additional 
Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original Code must also 
be retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code.
3.2 Alternative License.  Provided that Recipient is in compliance with 
the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation 
of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source 
code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; 
(2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor of Modifications;
and/or (3) a license of Recipient's choosing, containing terms different from
this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and

by any other terms of such license.  If Recipient elects to use any license
other than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its
terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by
SGI.  It is emphasized that this License is a limited license, and, regardless
of the license form employed by Recipient in accordance with this Section 3.2,
Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by
SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI in this License.
3.3 Indemnity.  Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability 
incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms Recipient 
offers.
4.  Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails 
to cure such breach within 30 days thereof.  Any sublicense to the Covered 
Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License,
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense.  Provisions that, by 
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, 
shall survive.
5.  No Trademark Or Other Rights.  This License does not grant any rights 
to:  (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other 
rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, 
estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, 
trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any 
related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived 
from the Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or 
(iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all 
times remains with SGI.  All rights in the Original Code not expressly 
granted under this License are reserved.  
6.  Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement.  There are various worldwide 
laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of 
Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import 
control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S.  government 
and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such 
laws, regulations, and executive orders.  Recipient may not distribute 
Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) 
any intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person
or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been
subject.
7.  Claims of Infringement.  If Recipient learns of any third party
claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient
will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
8.  Versions of the License.  SGI may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.  
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use 
it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code 
under the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI.
Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
9.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS."  ALL EXPRESS AND
IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS

DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS

THIS DISCLAIMER.

THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.
11.  Indemnity.  Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, 
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.  
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.  
from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including 
the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use, 
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or out of 
any representation or warranty made by Recipient.
12.  U.S.  Government End Users.  The Covered Code is a "commercial
item" consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S.  Government End Users
acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the terms
of this License.
13.  Miscellaneous.  This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
the its subject matter.  If any provision of this License is held to be 
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly 
as possible the same legal and economic effect as the original provision 
and the remainder of this License will remain in effect.  This License
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United
States and the State of California as applied to agreements entered into and to
be performed entirely within California between California residents.  Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the exclusive

absent subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of
California), with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.  The application of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

No Warranty

Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty for the

repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will 
any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute 
SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, 
incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability
to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the SAX

been advised of the possibility of such damages.
