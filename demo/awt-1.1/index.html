<h1>
Examples of Using the JDK 1.1 AWT
</h1>

This page contains links to examples
(applets and their source code)
of using new features in the JDK 1.1 AWT.
These examples were provided by the AWT team.

<h2>How to Run 1.1 Examples</h2>
</a>

To view the applets on the following pages, you can use
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/">the HotJava browser</a> 
or the JDK Applet Viewer.

<p>

Because the applets on the following pages
depend on 1.1 features,
<b>they do not run in 1.0 browsers!</b>
Microsoft and Netscape browsers
are still based on 1.0 --
they don't run 1.1 applets.

<p>

If you attempt to view the following pages in a 1.0 browser such as
Netscape Navigator 4.0, you will be given a button to press which will
display a picture of what the applets would look like running under
1.1.

The following examples all run successfully in
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/">the HotJava browser</a> 
and the JDK Applet Viewer.

<h2>The Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="lightweight/index.html">Lightweight Components</a>
    <br>
    Includes general instructions for creating and using
    lightweight components.
    Contains applets that show off the following lightweight components:
    round buttons, Openlook buttons,
    spinners, and gauges.
<p>
<li><a href="eventmodel/index.html">JDK 1.1 Event Examples</a>
    <br>
    Includes examples of handling mouse, mouse motion, and
    window events using inner classes (anonymous or named).
    Also shows how to redispatch events.
<p>
<li><a href="symboltest/index.html">Unicode</a>
    (and using an inner class for event handling)
<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    This example doesn't fully work under the 1.1beta3 release,
    since Symbol and Zapf Dingbat mapping to Unicode characters
    isn't supported until after beta3.
</ul>

Looking for other examples?
Some of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/relnotes/demos.html">Demonstration Applets and Applications</a>
have 1.1 versions.
