two actions when you enter it:
<ol>
<li>It prints the word "Hi!" in the status line.
<li>It plays an audio file of me saying "Hi".
</ol>
<li>My left eye is surrounded by a rectangle which highlights and prints
the words "That's my left eye" when you enter it.
<li>My right eye is surrounded by a rectangle which highlights and prints
the words "That's my right eye" when you enter it.

as you face the picture (on <em>my</em> right in the picture) is surrounded
by a 3-D button which takes you to the Java home page when you click on it.
