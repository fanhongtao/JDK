MemoryMonitor demonstrates the use of the java.lang.management API 
in observing the memory usage of all memory pools consumed by
the application.

This simple demo program queries the memory usage of each memory pool
and plots the memory usage history graph.

To run the MemoryMonitor demo

   java -jar <JDK_HOME>/demo/management/MemoryMonitor.jar 

These instructions assume that this installation's version of the java
command is in your path.  If it isn't, then you should either
specify the complete path to the java command or update your
PATH environment variable as described in the installation
instructions for the Java(TM) SDK.
