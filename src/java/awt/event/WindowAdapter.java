/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving window events.
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 * convenience for creating listener objects.
 * <P>
 * Extend this class to create a <code>WindowEvent</code> listener 
 * and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the 
 * <code>WindowrListener</code> interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 * all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * <P>
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with 
 * a Window using the window's <code>addWindowListener</code> 
 * method. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened,
 * closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified, 
 * the relevant method in the listener
 * object is invoked, and the <code>WindowEvent</code> is passed to it.
