/**
 * Supplement package private date-time formatting zone data for DateFormat.
 * DateFormatData used in DateFormat will be initialized by loading the data
 * from LocaleElements and DateFormatZoneData resources. The zone data are
 * represented with the following form:
 * {ID, new String[] {ID, long zone string, short zone string, long daylight 
 * string, short daylight string, representative city of zone}}, where ID is
 * NOT localized, but is used to look up the localized timezone data
 * internally. Localizers can localize any zone strings except
 * for the ID of the timezone.
 * Also, localizer should not touch "localPatternChars" entry.
