 * created for each evaluation.  A faster way is to precompile the
 * XPaths using the low-level API, and then just use the XPaths
 * over and over.
 *
 * NOTE: In particular, each call to this method will create a new
 * XPathContext, a new DTMManager... and thus a new DTM. That's very
 * safe, since it guarantees that you're always processing against a
 * fully up-to-date view of your document. But it's also portentially
 * very expensive, since you're rebuilding the DTM every time. You should
 * consider using an instance of CachedXPathAPI rather than these static
 * methods.
