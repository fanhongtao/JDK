/**
 * Notations are how the Document Type Description (DTD) records hints
 * about the format of an XML "unparsed entity" -- in other words,
 * non-XML data bound to this document type, which some applications
 * may wish to consult when manipulating the document. A Notation
 * represents a name-value pair, with its nodeName being set to the
 * declared name of the notation.
 * <P>
 * Notations are also used to formally declare the "targets" of
 * Processing Instructions.
 * <P>
 * Note that the Notation's data is non-DOM information; the DOM only
 * records what and where it is.
 * <P>
 * See the XML 1.0 spec, sections 4.7 and 2.6, for more info.
 * <P>
 * Level 1 of the DOM does not support editing Notation contents.
